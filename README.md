# Daily-Planner

**application gives a daily planner layout from 9am-5pm that accepts user input in sections(timeblocks)
**Timeblocks change color based on if theyre passed or outside the current time(grey being outdated or past current time, green being time that has still yet to happen via UPDATED CLOCK)
**When save is pressed on side of a timeblock its saved in local storage. IE page can be reset and the information will still be available.
